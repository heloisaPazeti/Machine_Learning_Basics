## Theory

### Supervised Learning

The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a corresponding output. Used for classification task like spam detection and regression task like predicting house prices. Some examples of algorithms are:
- Linear Regression;
- Logistic Regression;
- SVM;
- Decision Trees;
- Neural Networks.

### Unsupervised Learning

The model identifies patterns, clusters or associations independently. Used for Clusteringtask like customer segmentation and association task like market basket analysis. Some examples of algorithms are:
- K-Means;
- Hierarchical Clustering;
- PCA;
- Autoencoders.

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Only some of the input data is labelled. Some examples of use are:
- Text Classification;
- Image Classification;
- Anomaly Detection.

### Reinforcement Learning

Involves an agent that interacts with an environment, learning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success. Some examples of algorithms are:
- Q-learning;
- SARSA;
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
